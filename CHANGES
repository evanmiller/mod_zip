Changes with mod_zip 1.1.6                                       13 Sep 2010

    *) Feature: Support for UTF-8 filenames. Thanks to Robbie Scott/Bandcamp

    *) Feature: Issue subrequests serially. Thanks to Brian Moran/OneHub

    *) Feature: Use Zip64 when archive is larger than 4 GB. Thanks to Vasily 
       Fedoseyev.

    *) Bugfix: Support spaces in URLs.

Changes with mod_zip 1.1.5                                       03 Sep 2009

    *) Feature: "If-Range" client header is compared to "Last-Modified" and
       "ETag" from the upstream file-list server; if there is a match, the
       "Range" client header is honored, otherwise 200 OK is returned.
       Using "ETag" requires nginx 0.8.10 or later, or included patch.

    *) Bugfix: compatibility with nginx 0.7.25 and later (but earlier
       versions are no longer supported)

    *) Bugfix: Range works with local, Memcached, and FastCGI files

Changes with mod_zip 1.1.4                                       10 Feb 2009

    *) Bugfix: compilation error on FreeBSD

    *) Feature: Range end is optional (e.g. "bytes=0-")

Changes with mod_zip 1.1.3                                       13 Aug 2008

    *) Bugfix: crash when subrequests returned 404

    *) Bugfix: compatibility with BOMArchiveHelper.app on Mac OS X (but only
       when CRC-32's are supplied).

    *) Feature: CRC-32's are optional. Use "-" to have mod_zip calculate them
       on the fly. However, note that without CRC-32's up front, mod_zip will
       not honor "Range" requests.
